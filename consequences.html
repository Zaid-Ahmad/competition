				The governnment and all schools are working hard to not let the children be affected with this strange situation. Online classes are being held all over the country through various platforms (thanks to the IT companies), students are made sure they get the same environment they get in school while sitting at their homes. Though Covid-19 is causing great distress all over the country but it is helping all the people worldwide getting exposed to the internet and technology. Thus a blessing in disguise. Had this happened 10-20 years ago, it would have been incredibly difficult for all the students, office workers, teachers, etc. to work from home.

			Online learning has become a critical lifeline for education, as institutions seek to minimize the potential for community transmission. Technology can enable teachers and students to access specialized materials well beyond textbooks, in multiple formats and in ways that can bridge time and space. Also, School closures have put a strain on parents and guardians to provide childcare and manage distance learning while children are out of school. In the absence of alternative options, working parents often leave children alone when schools close and this can lead to risky behaviours, including increased influence of peer pressure and substance abuse. In addition to this, School closures negatively impact student learning outcomes. Schooling provides essential learning and when schools close, children and youth are deprived opportunities for growth and development. The disadvantages are disproportionate for under-privileged learners who tend to have fewer educational opportunities beyond school. When schools close, parents are often asked to facilitate the learning of children at home and can struggle to perform this task. This is especially true for parents with limited education and resources. Many children worldwide rely on free or discounted meals at schools. When schools close, nutrition is especially compromised for children in schools where food is provided.

				The fun fact is that this phase is making all the students learn how to manage things by themselves, they are slightly being exposed to the real world, how? Well they have to get up at time for online classes, manage their studies and homework, take out time for their health and family, etc. So, though this unusual phase has brought a lot of difficulties with itself, it has also brought with itself- great opportunites for people to learn about life and enahnce their favourite skills.
