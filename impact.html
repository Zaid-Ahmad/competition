			<p data-aos="zoom-out">The pressure on students and higher education institutions is high. Schools and universities have been closed and exams postponed. Classrooms are going virtual and admissions for the upcoming academic year are fraught with confusion. According to UNESCO, over 320 million students in Indian schools and colleges are currently impacted. As of 4 September 2020, approximately 1.277 billion learners were affected due to school closures in response to the pandemic. According to UNICEF monitoring, 46 countries implemented nationwide closures and 27 implemented local closures, impacting about 72.9 percent of the world's student population. 72 countries' schools are currently open. </p><br>
			<p data-aos="zoom-out">The lockdowns in response to COVID-19 have interrupted conventional schooling with nationwide school closures in most OECD and partner countries, the majority lasting at least 10 weeks. While the educational community have made concerted efforts to maintain learning continuity during this period, children and students have had to rely more on their own resources to continue learning remotely through the Internet, television or radio. Teachers also had to adapt to new pedagogical concepts and modes of delivery of teaching, for which they may not have been trained. In particular, learners in the most marginalised groups, who donâ€™t have access to digital learning resources or lack the resilience and engagement to learn on their own, are at risk of falling behind.</p>
