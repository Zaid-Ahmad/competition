				Distance learning support measures announced by the Italian government in March 2020 to equip schools with digital platforms and tools for distance learning, lend digital devices to less well-off students, and train school staff in methodologies and techniques for distance learning (Republic of Italy, 2020[10]). In May 2020 Italy announced new measures which seek to provide extra funding to cover costs arising from responses to the pandemic crisis at the school and university level (Republic of Italy, 2020[11]). This extra funding will cover the costs associated with special services, safety equipment and cleaning material needed in schools and universities for the next academic year, among other things. Additional financial resources were approved to recruit new teachers for primary to secondary level for the next school year. Emergency financial grants to cover partial or total course-related costs were announced for less well-off tertiary students.
